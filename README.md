# pp-jta

The junction tree algorithm implemented in Julia for the course Probabilistic Programming and AI @ TU Wien.

## Getting started

We used Julia 1.9.4 to implement the algorithm.
Assuming you have Julia installed, run `julia`.  
In the REPL go to package mode with `]`.  
Activate the current project using `activate`.  
And finally install all dependencies using `instantiate`.
